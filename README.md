# SPOR
A SPatial Ontology Reasoner for Multi-scale GEOBIA Ontologies

This is the repository of SPOR designed to reason over multi-scale GEOBIA ontologies, by employing fuzzy spectral, geometric, textural, and spatial relationships. 

To formalize the ontology an enhanced version of OWL 2 with fuzzy semantics is employed.

An ontology compatible with SPOR can be found in the following URL:

https://ontohub.org/repositories/geobia-ontologies/ontologies/9893

SPOR is distributed under GPL v3 or later.


SPOR depends on libpqxx (C++ interface of PostgreSQL), libxml2, Boost and DLib for SVM and Deep Learning (to be added) classification.
